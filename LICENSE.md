## Project Title
Peace Digital: Automated Investigative Technology

## Project Description
- Firstly, let us delve into the Reid Technique, pioneered by John E. Reid in the 1950s. This method, initially developed by a polygraph expert and former Chicago Police Officer, emphasizes creating a high-pressure environment followed by expressions of sympathy and understanding. While the Reid Technique has been effective in obtaining confessions, it has faced criticism for its potential to induce false confessions through psychological manipulation.
- In contrast, the Peace Model, introduced in 2017, represents a paradigm shift in interrogation methodology. This approach advocates for a more collaborative and non-accusatory dialogue between investigators and suspects, aiming to elicit a comprehensive account of events rather than solely focusing on obtaining confessions. The Peace Model's emphasis on communication and empathy serves to mitigate the risk of false confessions.
- The introduction of Peace Digital represents a significant advancement in investigative technology, aligning with the principles of the Peace Model. By leveraging machine learning and sentiment analysis, Peace Digital streamlines the evaluation phase of interrogation, providing investigators with valuable insights into suspects' consistency and credibility or trustworthiness. This automated approach not only enhances the efficiency of investigations but also helps mitigate the potential for bias and human error.

## How It Works
### Steps

1. **Homepage**
   - Enforcers may choose to log in or signup on the homepage [Landing Page URL](http://127.0.0.1:8000/peace/).
2. **Sign Up**
   - Enforcers enter their badge number based on the department they belong to, password, and confirm password. The badge number field only accepts integers. Upon successful signup, enforcers are directed to the login page.
3. **Login**
   - Enforcers enter their badge number based on the department they belong to and password. Upon successful login, enforcers are directed to the forms page.
4. **Forms Page/Enforcer Dashboard**
   - The dashboard has navigation sidebars where enforcers can choose what actions to perform.
5. **Responses**
   - Responses link to the suspect questionnaire form. A unique serial number is generated when the questionnaire form is submitted successfully. The serial number is displayed on the success page.
6. **Report**
   - The report links to the form that prompts enforcers to enter the serial number generated when the questionnaire form was submitted. When the enforcer enters the correct serial number, the case report is downloaded into the enforcer's local machine in the "Downloads" folder.
