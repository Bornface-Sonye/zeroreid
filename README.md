# Welcome to Peace Digital Portal üåü

## Introduction:

Firstly, let us delve into the Reid Technique, pioneered by John E. Reid in the 1950s. This method, initially developed by a polygraph expert and former Chicago Police Officer, emphasizes creating a high-pressure environment followed by expressions of sympathy and understanding. While the Reid Technique has been effective in obtaining confessions, it has faced criticism for its potential to induce false confessions through psychological manipulation.

In contrast, the Peace Model, introduced in 2017, represents a paradigm shift in interrogation methodology. This approach advocates for a more collaborative and non-accusatory dialogue between investigators and suspects, aiming to elicit a comprehensive account of events rather than solely focusing on obtaining confessions. The Peace Model's emphasis on communication and empathy serves to mitigate the risk of false confessions.

Now, let us turn our attention to the Peace Digital application, a groundbreaking development in investigative technology. Peace Digital leverages modern advancements such as machine learning and sentiment analysis to automate the Peace Model's phases, particularly focusing on the evaluation phase. By calculating emotion scores, confidence scores, obedient scores, and consistency scores based on suspects' responses, Peace Digital aims to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of decision-making during investigations.

## Conclusion:

The Reid Technique and the Peace Model indeed represent contrasting approaches to interrogation, each with its own set of advantages and criticisms. The Reid Technique's reliance on pressure and manipulation to extract confessions has led to concerns about its potential for inducing false confessions, which can have serious consequences for innocent individuals.

On the other hand, the Peace Model's emphasis on collaboration and empathy aims to create a more ethical and effective interrogation process. By fostering open communication and understanding between investigators and suspects, the Peace Model seeks to reduce the risk of false confessions while still obtaining valuable information.
